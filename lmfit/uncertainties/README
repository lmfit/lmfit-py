This is a modified version of the uncertainties package Eric O. Lebigot.  See the Python Package
Index (PyPI) and/or the github source repository (at https://github.com/lebigot/uncertainties) for
more complete documentation on this package.

The changes here were forked from version 0.9 of the uncertainties packages, and add the ability
to calculate uncertainties on wrapped python functions that include keyword arguments.  This is
important for lmfit, as it allows estimates of uncertainties in constrained parameters.

The changes made here were submitted for inclusion in the uncertainties package, but not
accepted. Since the enhancement is useful for lmfit, the forked version is included here.
