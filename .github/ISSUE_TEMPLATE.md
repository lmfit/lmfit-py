### DO NOT IGNORE ###

READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FULLY. IF YOU DO NOT, YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED.

If you have not submitted a GitHub Issue to lmfit before, read
[this](https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

***DO NOT USE GitHub Issues for questions, it is only for bugs in the lmfit code!***

Issues here are concerned with errors or problems in the lmfit code.  
We use it as our bug tracker.  There are other places to get support 
and help with using lmfit. 

If you **think** something is an Issue, it probably is not an Issue. If the 
behavior you want to report involves a fit that runs to completion without 
raising an exception but that gives a result that you think is incorrect, 
that is almost certainly not an Issue.

Use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/lmfit-py) or
[GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py/discussions) for
questions about lmfit or things you think might be problems.  We don't feel
obligated to spend our free time helping people who do not respect our
chosen work processes, so if you ignore this advice and post a question as
a GitHub Issue anyway, it is quite likely that your Issue will be closed
and not answered. If you have any doubt at all, do NOT submit an Issue.

To submit an Issue, you MUST provide ALL of the following information.  If
you delete any of these sections, your Issue may be closed. If you think one
of the sections does not apply to your Issue, state that explicitly. We will 
probably disagree with you and insist that you provide that information. If
we have to ask for it twice,  we will expect it to be correct and prompt.
