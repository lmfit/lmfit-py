Downloading and Installation
====================================

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lmfit package requires Python, Numpy, and Scipy.  Scipy version 0.11 or
higher is recommended, but extensive testing on version compatibility has
not been done.  Initial tests do work with Python 3.2, but little testing
with Python 3 has yet been done.  No testing has been done with 64-bit
architectures, but as this package is pure Python, no significant troubles
are expected. Nose is a requirement for running the test suite.

.. _uncertainties: http://packages.python.org/uncertainties/

If installed, the `uncertainties`_ package will be used for propagation of
uncertainties to constrained parameters.

LMFIT was originally written by Matthew Newville.  Substantial code and
documentation improvements, especially for improved estimates of confidence
intervals was provided by Till Stensitzki.  The implementation of parameter
bounds as described in the MINUIT documentation is taken from Jonathan
J. Helmus' leastsqbound code, with permission. Many valuable suggestions
for improvements have come from Christoph Deil.  The code obviously depends
on, and owes a very large debt to the code in scipy.optimize.  Several
discussions on the scipy mailing lists have also led to improvements in
this code.
