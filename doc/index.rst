The lmfit Python package provides a simple, flexible interface to
non-linear least-squares optimization, or curve fitting.  By default, lmfit
uses and builds upon he `Levenberg-Marquardt`_ minimization algorithm from
`MINPACK-1`_ as implemented in `scipy.optimize.leastsq`_.  Support for
other optimization routines is being added.  Currently, the `L-BFGS`_
(limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithm as implemented
in `scipy.optimize.l_bfgs_b`_ or the `simulated annealing`_ algorithm as
implemented in `scipy.optimize.anneal`_ are both implemented and partially
tested, and other optimization routines are being considered.  As the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the most tested and appears to be the most
robust for finding local minima of well-described models of scientific
measurements, parts of this document may assume that it Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm is being discussed.

For any minimization problem, the programmer must provide a function that takes a set of
values for the variables in the fit, and produces the residual function to be minimized in
the least-squares sense.

The lmfit package allows models to be written in terms of a set of Parameters, which are
extensions of simple numerical variables with the following properties:

 * Parameters can be fixed or floated in the fit.
 * Parameters can be bounded with a minimum and/or maximum value.
 * Parameters can be written as simple mathematical expressions of
   other Parameters, using the `asteval`_ module (which must be installed
   separately). These values will be re-evaluated at each step in the fit,
   so that the expression is satisfied.  This gives a simple but flexible
   approach to constraining fit variables.

The main advantage to using Parameters instead of fit variables is that the model function
does not have to be rewritten for a change in what is varied or what constraints are
placed on the fit.  The programmer can write a fairly general model, and allow a user of
the model to change what is varied and what constraints are placed on the model.

For the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, lmfit also calculates and reports the
estimated uncertainties and correlation between fitted variables.
